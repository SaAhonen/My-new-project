# How to find peer-reviewed information for master's thesis

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI searches for peer-reviewed literature and articles


## Background

The idea should help you find suitable sources for your Master's thesis. The problem is common, as the recommendation is to use as recent publications as possible, but these are not always peer-reviewed.


## How is it used?

The users would be the students working on the Master's Thesis. This could also be applied to any other thesis, dissertation, etc. The user base could be very broad. The user searches for a keyword or several 
keywords in the library he/she considers appropriate.

## Data sources and AI methods
Articles, books and publications can be found in educational libraries, online libraries, Google Scholar, etc. The data already exists, but finding the right sources can be tricky.

## Challenges

Projekti ei ratkaise lähteen sopivuuden arviointia kyseiseen työhön (Master's Thesis, jne.), se jää käyttäjän arvioitavaksi. Lisäksi käyttäjän arvioitavaksi jää tiedon luotettavuus.

## What next?

The project requires programming skills that I don't have. In addition, there should be an interface with the electronic libraries of different educational institutions.
